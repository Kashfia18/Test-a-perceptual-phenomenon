# Test-a-perceptual-phenomenon
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink.  The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed.

The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition.  In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed.  In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed.

In each case, the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists are measured. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

We want to see how the mean of the time differences for the two samples are different using bootstrap method and paired t-test.
